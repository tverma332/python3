# Math Module

Python math module is defined as the most famous mathematical functions, which includes trigonometric functions, representation functions, logarithmic functions, etc. Furthermore, it also defines two mathematical constants, i.e., Pie and Euler number, etc.

### Constants provided by the math module
---
Math module provides various the value of various constants like pi, tau. Having such constants saves the time of writing the value of each constant every time we want to use it and that too with great precision.

Math module provides various the value of various constants like :
* pi
* tau
* Euler's number

### Numeric Functions
----
In this , we will deal with the functions that are used with number theory as well as representation theory such as finding the factorial of a number
* factorial
* ceil
* floor
* pow , etc
