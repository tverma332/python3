# subprocess module
* Default module in python
* Used to execute operating system commands
* The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes

NOTE : Before this we had os.system("cmd") to run operating system commands but the problem with that command was that we couldn't able to store output of command in variable instead we get only 0 = sucess | 1 = not success only , it was drawback of os.system("cmd") so we will be using subprocess module wherever we need the output of the command to be saved in variable.
