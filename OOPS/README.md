# OOPS
* Python supports both OOPS and Procedural programming concepts 

**`Procedural`** : If we implement any code in terms of functions

**`OOPS`** : 

* It is about class , object , Inheritance , Polymorphism , Data Abstraction and Data Encapsulation
* Basically OOPS is all about usage of class and object

**`Object`** : Object could be anything which exists in real-time , like human , fan , car , email , any application , jenskins , weblogic , tomcat , etc.

Each object has characteristics and functions:

*For Ex* - Person

* **Characteristics (variable)** : Name , Age
* **Function(To implement logic)** : Walking , talking and running
