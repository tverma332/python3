# Tuple

> Note : Tuples are immutable as strings

### Operations on Tuple :
---
Mainly it has index , count , etc but do not have modify operations like insert , extend , append becaase tuples are immutable
 

```py
x = 5     : int
x = 5,    : Tuple
x = 5,6,7 : Tuple
```

`Real life scenario` : When taking some data , by logic if you want to change it then take list and if even by mistake you don't want to change then take tuple
