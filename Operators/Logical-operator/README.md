# Logical Operator
* Logical operators are useful to combine multiple conditions.
* There are three types of logical operators in python: <br>
&nbsp; 1. and <br>
&nbsp; 2. or <br>
&nbsp; 2. not <br>

1. For `AND` operator - It returns TRUE if both the operands (right side and left side) are true

2. For `OR` operaor - It return TRUE if either of the operand (right side or left side ) is true

3. Logical `NOT` operator work with the single boolean value. If the boolean value is True it returns False and vice-versa

NOTE : In case of multiple conditions
```
Simple syntax for AND:
all([2<3 , 4>5 , 8>7])
---
Simple syntax for OR:
any([2<3 , 4>5 , 8>7])
```
